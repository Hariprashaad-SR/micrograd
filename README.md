# Micrograd

Micrograd is a minimalist deep learning library that demonstrates the principles of automatic differentiation. It allows users to define computational graphs and compute gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to their inputs using reverse-mode autograd. This library is designed for educational purposes to illustrate the core concepts of backpropagation and gradient descent in neural networks.
